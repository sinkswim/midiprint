MidiPrint Notes and TODO

NOTES:
	—— the purpose of this tool is to display midi devices connected to the system, print midi messages on screen (raw info or key light up)

TODO:
	—- add graphical user interface: single responsive octave keyboard (keys light up when callback function is invoked)
	—- test on other midi devices
	

DONE:
	--improve tool printing out all devices that are connected and their midi messages (mpkmini -> all)

OLD PROGRAM (printed mpkMINI messages only):
	create a MIDIClientRef midiClient
	create a MIDIPortRef midiInputPort, here we declare the midiInputCallback that will be called when in CFRunLoop
	get number of sources numSources
	cycle through sources; if endpoint is MPK mini:
								 initialize MIDIObjectRef mpkEndpoint
								 assert(mpkEndpoint != 0)
								 connect endpoint to previously created inputPort MIDIPortConnectSource(inputPort, mpkEndpoint, NULL)
								 CFRunLoopRun()
